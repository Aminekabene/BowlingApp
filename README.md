#  Welcome to the Bowling Simulator!

## Description :

This is a very simple java program that allows you to simulate a game of Bowling. You can play multiple games simultianosly. 
The Program will calculate your score and keep track of your rolls. Also, not to worry the program will let you know you're rolling an illegal ball.  

## How to get Started :

- open-up the file `/src/main.java`
- create an instance of the Game class (No parameters needed) ex: `Game game = new game();`
- Roll the ball by calling `game.roll(6);` the methods takes as argument the number of pins knocked down. A score board will be printed after each roll.
- Call `game.score()` to print the total score with bonuses up to your current roll.
- Keep rolling until the message `Game Over!`is printed.

### Have fun! ;)
